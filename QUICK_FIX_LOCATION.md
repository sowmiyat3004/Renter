## üìã What You Should Have

After the fix, you should have **BOTH** of these in Render Environment:

```
‚úÖ GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
‚úÖ NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

**Note:** Both can use the EXACT SAME value!

## ‚ùì Why Two Variables?

- **`GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`** (no prefix)
  - For server-side API calls
  - Used in `/api/google-places` endpoint
  
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`** (with prefix)
  - For browser/client-side
  - Used by Google Maps JavaScript API
  - MUST have `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for Next.js

## üîí Optional: API Key Restrictions

For better security, restrict your API key in Google Cloud Console:

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Click on your API key
3. Under "Application restrictions":
   - Select "HTTP referrers"
   - Add: `https://*.onrender.com/*`
   - Add: `http://localhost:3000/*`
4. Under "API restrictions":
   - Select: Maps JavaScript API
   - Select: Places API
   - Select: Geocoding API
5. Click "Save"

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

1. Copy value from `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`
2. Add new variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` = same value
3. Save and redeploy
4. Location search will work!
